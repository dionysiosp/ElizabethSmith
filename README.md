üé≠ Theatrics and Code
This repository is not just about code; it's about embracing the theatrics of programming. Expect commits that read like Shakespearean soliloquies and variable names that pay homage to the queen's favorite corgis. The code isn't just functional; it's a performance art piece that brings a touch of regal elegance to your development journey.

ü§£ Why So Serious?
